    "## School Bus Routing Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description:\n",
    "A school district has a set of schools (denoted by set `I`) and a fleet of school buses (denoted by set `J`). Each bus needs to be assigned to a school every morning to pick up students. The cost `c_{ij}` represents the fuel cost for bus `j` to reach school `i` and complete the route. The district aims to minimize the total fuel cost while ensuring that each school is served by exactly one bus and each bus is assigned to exactly one school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indices:\n",
    "- `i` - Index for schools, where `i` belongs to set `I`\n",
    "- `j` - Index for buses, where `j` belongs to set `J`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters:\n",
    "- `c_{ij}` - Fuel cost for bus `j` to serve school `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables:\n",
    "- `x_{ij}` - 1 if bus `j` is assigned to school `i`, 0 otherwise.\n",
