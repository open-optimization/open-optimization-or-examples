    "Certainly! The binary knapsack problem is one of the most famous combinatorial optimization problems. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value (or cost in this context), the problem is to determine the number of each item to include in a knapsack so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit `W` and the total value (or cost) is as large as possible.\n",
