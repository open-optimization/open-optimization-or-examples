    "# Toy Maker Problem\n",
    "Consider the problem of a toy company that produces toy planes and toy boats. The toy company can sell its planes for $\\$10$ and its boats for $\\$8$ dollars. It costs $\\$3$ in raw materials to make a plane and $\\$2$ in raw materials to make a boat. A plane requires $3$ hours to make and $1$ hour to finish while a boat requires $1$ hour to make and $2$ hours to finish. The toy company knows it will not sell anymore than $35$ planes per week. Further, given the number of workers, the company cannot spend anymore than $160$ hours per week finishing toys and $120$ hours per week making toys. The company wishes to maximize the profit it makes by choosing how much of each toy to produce. "
